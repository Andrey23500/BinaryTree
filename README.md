# BinaryTree

Data structures are classified into linear and non-linear data structures. A tree is a non-linear data structure. Data is stored hierarchically in a non-linear data structure. So the tree is a way of organizing data hierarchically. A tree grows from top to bottom. In a tree, there are different kinds of nodes that are linked with each other. A tree consists of the following elements:

   **Node**: It is an element of a tree.

   **Root**: It is the starting node of a tree. It is the top most element that has no parent element.

   **Parent Node**: It is the node that has branches from top to bottom. It is the immediate predecessor of any node.

   **Child Node**: It is the node that has a node from bottom to top. It is the instantaneous successor of any node.

   **Level**: Each step in a tree is level.

   **Leaf Node**: It is the node having no child.

   **Non-Leaf Node**: It is the node having at least one child.

   **Edge**: It is the link between two nodes.


In a binary tree,  every node in a tree should have a maximum of two children.
